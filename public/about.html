<p>I did a graduation in Chemical engineering from JNTU Anantapur.As i was studying my intrest diverted into web devolopment . So i studied about it and find it very much intresting rather than my core branch subjects. So i decided to start web devoloping and find a way through it and find my niche in it . Here I am today as a web devloper and hoping to do better everyay and learn everyday.</p>
